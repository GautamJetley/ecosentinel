# EcoSentinel — AI Environmental Change Detector

Upload BEFORE & AFTER satellite images to:
- compute a change map (SSIM + OpenCV),
- estimate % area impacted,
- generate a concise environmental report with Meta Llama (via Groq),
- optionally enhance with Cerebras (“Mitigation & Next Steps”),
- all packaged in Docker for one-command reproducibility.

## Run (Docker)
